Working with plug gauges, snap gauges and gauge blocks 
The specified limits of bores of toleranced workpieces can be checked by plug gauges. Snap gauges or ring gauges are used to test the specified limits of shafts. Plug gauges (figure) When using a cylindrical plug gauge, the diameter of one side, the Go should enter while the No Go should fail to enter the hole. As a result, it is stated to be within the specified limits. Cylindrical plug gauges are made from alloyed steel or tungsten carbide. They are ground and lapped. They can be produced to any size up to 250 mm diameter. The Go side should slide into the bore by its own weight. A minimal insertion of the No Go gauge may be tolerated at the entry fit. The Go side is longer and often has carbide inserts to reduce the wear of the surface. The No Go side is shorter, marked with a red ring and shows the maximum limit size. Snap gauges (figure) The Go side represents the maximum limit size. It must slide over the measured surface by its own weight. The No Go member is smaller and should fail to slide over the surface. It has slightly angled measuring surfaces, which are red and show the minimum limit size. Gauge blocks Gauge blocks are the most important and precise dimensional representations. They are usually made in sets of rectangular, square or angular steel blocks or ceramic blocks (figure). Each block has two opposite faces lapped flat and parallel to a definite size within an extremely tight tolerance. In order to assemble a gauge block stack of a certain size, you first write down the correct combination of gauge blocks for these dimensions. Tip: start with the smallest available gauge block. Example: Assemble a gauge block stack for the dimension: 57.005 mm. Careful: There is no gauge block of 0.005 mm. It would break!
