Measuring errors 
The indicated values of a measuring instrument are afflicted with different measuring errors. The errors can be caused by: –Deviation of the standard temperature of 20 °C Operator variations: –thin workpieces could be deformed by a high measuring force –parallax error is due to the incorrect eye position when reading the scale Measuring errors can be divided into two categories: Systematic errors: They are caused by constant variations, such as the temperature in the workshop, the measuring force or an inaccurate scale or wear of the measuring instrument. Systematic errors can be avoided by eliminating the cause of the error, such as a proper calibration of the measuring instrument. Random errors are caused by unknown variations, such as an un intended change in temperature or measuring force or parallax error. They can be reduced by repeating the measurement for a few times and using a calculated mean value. Measuring capability If you need to measure a workpiece, it is difficult to know which measuring instrument should be used. The correct choice of measuring device saves time, money and can provide you with an ac curate result. The choice of a suitable measuring instrument for a certain measuring task depends on the required accuracy and the dimension of the workpiece. By using your Metal Trade Handbook (extract in the table) you can find out the uncertainty and the range of the instrument. Example: The uncertainty of mechanical measuring instruments is one scale interval. Digital measuring instruments have an uncertainty of three numerical intervals
