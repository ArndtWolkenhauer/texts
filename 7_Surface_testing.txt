Surface testing 
In industrial manufacturing the machined surface has a major influence on the quality and performance of the end product. The surface texture of a workpiece is the deviation of a surface from its ideal shape e. g. perfect flat, cylindrical or spherical form. The measure of the surface texture indicates the form, the waviness and the roughness (figure). The form deviation (1st degree of deviation describes the straightness or roundness of the part. Deviations from the required form can result from clamping marks or wear in the guides of the machine tool. Waviness (2nd degree deviation) usually relates to the characteristics of an individual machine or to external environmental factors. It may result from the machine itself, e. g. its vibrations. The roughness (3rd/4th degree deviation), e. g. grooves or bumps result from the production process. It is influenced by the geometry or the material structure of the cutting tool and the feed or the depth of the tool. The irregularities of a surface can be checked by different measuring instruments. The output of these devices are certain pro files. The base of a roughness (R) and waviness (W) profile is the primary (P) profile. Types of surface testing Surface roughness comparators are used for touch and sight comparison. In order to get an accurate measuring result you need to use the same material of the test specimen and workpiece and the correct manufacturing technology, e. g. turning, milling, grinding etc. You need to scrape the comparator specimen with your fingernail or use a small copper coin. Then you can compare the surface of the workpiece with the comparator specimen. If you compare it visually, you need an optimum light source angle or use a magnifying glass. Stylus instruments are surface roughness testers, which record the peaks and valleys by a diamond stylus (figure). The stylus is drawn at a constant speed across the workpiece. The amount to which the stylus is raised or lowered is printed in a diagram. It shows the increased surface profile.
