A New Colleague
Max is an apprentice at the company FINE METALS near Munich. This morning in the training workshop, the instructor introduces a new colleague from England to Max. 
"Hello Max, this is John Mulligan from Manchester. He will join you during the vocational training." Hello John, welcome in Germany. I have been an apprentice in this company for two months." 
"Nice to see you, Max. Can you tell me something about the training?" 
"Of course John. Please ask if you can't understand it." 
Max shows John the training area. There are workbenches with bench vices and the tools for the skilled manual work: files, chisels, hammers, screwdrivers, twist drills etc. On the first day of the training, they learn how to file a small piece of a flat bar. They practise to file flat areas and perpendicular side faces on the workpiece. The instructor shows them how to measure the length, width and thickness of the workpiece with a calliper. The flatness of the surfaces is checked with a straight edge. The right angle of the side faces is measured with an engineer's square. The next day they practise drilling bores into the workpiece. The bores have different diameters and definite distances from the edges. They learn to read measures out of an engineering drawing. They mark lines with a scriber on the workpiece and set centre punches. The instructor shows them how to determine the right rotational speed of the drilling machine and the suitable type of drill. After leaving the training section in the afternoon, Max shows John the manufacturing shop floors of the company. For the weekend Max invites John to go on a trip to a German Biergarten. "There you can enjoy German brass music, eat Brezels and drink beer." You can meet many friendly young people there.
