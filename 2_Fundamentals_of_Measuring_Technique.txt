Fundamentals of Measuring Techniques
If components are produced in a workshop, e. g. a slide rail (figure), the dimensions of the workpiece must be given precisely. Important dimensions of the slide rail are the length of 22 mm, the height of 24.5 mm, the angle of 90° and the internal diameters of 6.6 mm and 11 mm. In order to measure these features, different inspection aids are needed (figure). They can be divided into three main categories: measuring devices, gauges and auxiliary aids.
With some measuring devices you compare a certain dimension, such as the height of 24.5 mm with a scale of a measuring device. These instruments are called dimensional representations, e. g. steel rules or folding meter. If you read the dimension from a scale of the measuring device you use an indicative measuring device, such as a calliper, a pro tractor, or a micrometer. With gauges you can test e. g. the diameter of a ∅ 6.6 mm hole (bore) with a plug limit gauge, or you can check the radius of R9 by a radius gauge.
