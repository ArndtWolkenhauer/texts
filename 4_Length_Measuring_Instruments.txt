Length Measuring Instruments 
For measuring the length of a workpiece, there is a variety of test instruments with different degrees of accuracy. You can measure the length with a rule or a tape rule and check the size with a gauge or a gauge block. Rules (figure) represent the length measurement by the distance of little lines on a scale. There are different types of rules available: flexible steel rules, tape rules or folding meters. Scales (figure) for the position measurement systems are made of glass or steel and are operated by the photoelectronic scanning principle. When parallel light passes through a scale, light and dark surfaces are projected at a certain distance and signals are generated. Straight edges (figure) are used to check the straightness and flatness. They have lapped test blades with a high flatness. These accurate test blades enable the naked eye to realize different tiny light gaps. The light gap between the test blade and the workpiece could be as small as 2 µm. Engineer’s squares (figure) are form gauges and represent mostly an angle of 90°. They are used to check the perpendicularity and flatness of surfaces. Be sides, cylindrical or flat surfaces can be adjusted. The measuring tubes can have dimensions up to 100 × 70 mm with a class of accuracy of 00. The limit of perpendicularity deviation is only 3 µm. Gauges represent certain dimensions or geometric forms (figure). Measurement gauges come in sets, e. g. gauge blocks or test pins. Form gauges can check angles, radii and threads using the light gap method. Plug gauges and snap gauges represent the admissible maximum and minimum limit dimension. Some gauges represent also the form, e. g. to test the cylindrical form of a bore as well as the dimension of the hole.
